## Manual Experiment Setup

Often I need to run a bunch of experiments manually where I tweak the values and code to my preference. Using an experiment tracker is overkill for this purpose(I think?). This is an attempt to build out a simple exp setup for such cases

### Requirements
`guild` is really the only requirements for this setup. So this should suffice `pip install guildai`


### Workflow
* To start with run `guild init`.

    <summary>Note</summary>
    Strictly put this is not necessary. I simply like to do this as it creates the `.guild` directory in the root folder of the project rather than wherever guild creates this
    </details>
* For a simple test a guild file look like this:
  ```yml
  experiment:
  description: Run the experiement setup once
  main: run # Replace with whatever your main file is
  flags-dest: config:config.yml
  flags-import: all
  ```
  Here `config.yml` can be a `json` file or `ini` file. Flags can also be specified by creating a `flags` section in this file or adding a `# Hyperparameters` comment in the `run.py` file. Guild accepts both
* To run this setup use `guild run experiment`. Add a `-y` flag to run without confirmation
* To view the experiments on the board run `guild view`
